## Introduction

Digital Stethoscope aims at producing an electronics based amplifying stethoscope, which can store/ transmit the sound waveform captured to another device. Some of the advantages and motivation to switch from mechanically to electronically based amplifying are :
- Better amplification, and a more flexible range of amplification
- Noise reduction capabilities 
- Ability to store and transmit sound captures in order to analyse them on a later date 

### Technologies Used
We have used the following technologies and software for our project

## Objectives 
The main goals we have set out for this project are 
- Make a microphone - amplification module that can detect frequencies from 50Hz to 20kHz 
- Transmit the sound clip to an associated laptop wirelessly 
- Be able to detect the disease by using an associated Deep Learning model <hr>

<p>The microcontroller that we are using in our project is the ESP32.
The ESP32 is a high-performance microcontroller board that is widely used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
Espressif Systems manufactures it, and it is the successor to the ESP8266. The ESP32 is built around a dual-core 
Tensilica LX6 processor that operates at up to 240 MHz, providing plenty of processing power for IoT applications.
</p>

The ESP32 microcontroller board has the following key features:
<ol>
<li>
    <em>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity:</em> The ESP32 includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, making it simple to connect to the internet and other devices.
</li>
<li>
    <em> Low power consumption:</em> The ESP32 is energy-efficient, with multiple power modes that allow it to operate on very little power.
</li>
<li>
    <em> Large Memory:</em> The ESP32 comes up with up to 520 KB of SRAM and 4MB of flash memory, which is enough to run complex applications.
</li>
<li>
    <em>GPIO pins:</em> The ESP32 has a large number of GPIO pins, which makes it easy to interface with other devices and sensors.
</li>
<li>
    <em>Development tools:</em> There are many development tools available for it including Arduino IDE, ESP-IDF, and MicroPython.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Overall, the ESP32 is a powerful and versatile microcontroller board that is well-suited for a wide range of IoT applications. Its built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, low power consumption, and large memory make it a popular choice among developers.

In this project, the esp32 is used to transmit the data collected from the microphone to the ML model over the in-built Wi-Fi.

<!--- MFCC STARTS HERE --->
<h1>MFCC</h1>
<p>
Speech Recognition is a supervised learning task. In the speech recognition problem input will be the audio signal and we have to predict the text from the audio signal. We canâ€™t take the raw audio signal as input to our model because there will be a lot of noise in the audio signal. It is observed that extracting features from the audio signal and using it as input to the base model will produce much better performance than directly considering raw audio signal as input. MFCC is the widely used technique for extracting the features from the audio signal.
