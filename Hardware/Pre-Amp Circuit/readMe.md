# What is Pre-Amplifier?
A preamplifier, also known as a preamp, is an electronic amplifier that converts a weak electrical signal into an output signal strong enough to be noise-tolerant and strong enough for further processing, or for sending to apower amplifier and loud speaker.
An ideal preamp will be linear **(have a constant gain through its operating range)**, have high input impedance **(requiring only a minimal amount of current to sense the input signal)** and a low output impedance **(when current is drawn from the output there is minimal change in the output voltage)**.
